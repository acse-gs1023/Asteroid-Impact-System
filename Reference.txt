During the development process, generative AI hsa been used in multiple parts. ChatGPT has been
used during developing idea stages, to help us understand physics and mathematical concepts. 
During code writing stages, ChatGPT has been used to generate simple code snippets such as ploting 
and translate simple mathematical equation to python functions. During code review part, we have used
github copliot and ChatGPT to generate test cases, as well as later been used to generate comments and 
docstring for documentation. All result generated from AI has went through careful revision, and AI has 
only been used to avoid redundant work and to enhance our knowledge.
