# ACS-1-deepimpact

## Problem Statement
Asteroids entering Earthâ€™s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. Stimulate the path of asteroid entering the earth's atmosphere and the zero point of impact. Further calculate the impacted radius and population by the asteroid impact.

For more details, refer to `ProjectDescription.ipynb`, `AirburstSolver.ipynb` and `DamageMapper.ipynb`.
